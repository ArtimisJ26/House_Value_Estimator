# LinkedIn Certification project

Certificate [Link](https://lnkd.in/drrTuYY4)

This is a home value estimator project created using Scikitlearn's Gradient Boosting Regressor. I have tried to replicate the results by trying out the code from the course for practice.

The credit for the code goes to the creator of this course [Adam Geitgey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ageitgey/)

- view_data.py will generate a .html file to view the data.
- train_model.py contains code to train and create a basic prediction model
- grid_search.py runs the model with different model parameters to find the best-performing options.
- feature_selection.py gives a list in order of the importance of each feature so that we can decide to eliminate the insignificant features.
